                    <p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Python, boto3 SDK, Pycharm unit testing</li>
                            <li>Lambda, DynamoDB, SNS, EC2</li>
                            <li>Terraform, Terraform Cloud</li>
                            <li>Git, GitHub, Github Actions</li>
                            <li>Amazon Web Services, Redash</li>
                        </ul>
                    </p>
                    <p>An AWS Lambda function, authored in Python and using boto3 to interact with other AWS resources,
                        downloads data related to COVID-19 and performs an ETL process. The data is written to DynamoDB,
                        where it can be queried by a self-hosted instance of Redash to create a visualization dashboard. A
                        message is sent to a Simple Notification Service topic whenever the process finishes or encounters
                        an error. The Lambda function is triggered daily by an Amazon EventBridge rule.</p>
                    <p>I am particularly pleased with the choice I made to provision all of my infrastructure using
                        Terraform. This was my first time using it, so I spent several hours learning the basics and
                        applying that knowledge to my configuration. Terraform seems like a great tool to use in my
                        pipelines going forward, especially if/as I branch out to other cloud providers.</p>
                    <p>Numerous challenges presented themselves throughout the development process. Some examples:</p>
                    <p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>After working out the Python logic locally, I used multiple AWS accounts for testing and
                                production. Each account's resources were deployed from a separate repository, which made
                                for a lot of copy/paste. This process could be streamlined using git branches and
                                environmental variables, something I would like to learn and practice.</li>
                            <li>An IAM permission scoping issue threw me for a loop, sidetracking the project for several
                                hours as I erroneously refactored the Terraform configuration.</li>
                            <li>There were several key parts to this challenge that I had to (or wanted to) learn from
                                scratch: boto3, AWS's Python SDK; Terraform; and unit testing in Python. Had these topics
                                been familiar to me already, I suspect this project would have taken far less time.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </p>
                    <p>Future improvements may include: refactoring the Terraform configuration file; writing more
                        comprehensive unit tests; and revisiting queries and visualizations in Redash.</p>

                    <p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Python</li>
                            <li>Flask, SQLAlchemy, smtplib, Werkzeug</li>

                        </ul>
                    </p>
                    <p>This webapp was created as a capstone project for the Python Bootcamp taught by Angela Yu of The App
                        Brewery. Some of the backend Flask code was written by me for an earlier project, while the frontend
                        code is almost exclusively written from scratch. It is deployed on AWS Elastic Beanstalk via
                        GitHub.</p>
                    <p>I am particularly pleased with two aspects of this application: styling the HTML with Bootstrap, a
                        framework with which I had little experience; and figuring out the deployment process, which
                        included using the AWS EB CLI tool locally, associating the application with a MySQL RDS instance,
                        and setting up a GitHub CI/CD pipeline to automatically push changes to Elastic Beanstalk.</p>
                    <p>Numerous challenges presented themselves throughout the development process. Some examples:</p>
                    <p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Proper form validation: I decided not to use wtf.quick_form() to create the various HTML
                                forms, so the validate_on_submit() method was invalid. Documentation led me to an alternate
                                method for validating form fields.</li>
                            <li>Custom CSS: I wanted to define my own color for the Bootstrap buttons, but importing the
                                Bootstrap CSS via a CDN meant that I had no easy way to manipulate built-in values. A good
                                deal of searching led me to the code I needed to calculate color hex values and create my
                                own btn-custom class.</li>
                            <li>SMTP: my web application was unable to send emails (from the Contact page) after being
                                deployed onto AWS. A trip into my EB environment's EC2 logs first revealed a CSRF error, so
                                I explicitly imported CSRFProtect from Flask-WTF. Although that hurdle was cleared, POST
                                requests continued to time out. Several searches on stackoverflow eventually revealed that
                                AWS throttles outbound EC2 traffic on port 25. Explicitly defining a different port for
                                SMTP traffic has restored email functionality.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </p>
                    <p>Future improvements may include: figuring out AJAX requests so that this webapp can be served
                        through CloudFront (caching and CSRF don't play nicely); defining Elastic Beanstalk configuration
                        settings with code, instead of manipulating the EB environment in the AWS console; improved blog
                        formatting and pagination; more error-handling; some sort of alert (email?) system when users
                        comment on a blog post.</p>

                    <p>I completed this project shortly after obtaining the AWS Solutions Architect Associate
                        certification and just before I began an online bootcamp to learn Python. As I didn't know much
                        code at that point, I chose to use a pre-built HTML/CSS template for the frontend. Loading the
                        website triggers an AWS Lambda function that increases the visitor count in a DynamoDB table by one
                        and returns the new count to the website.</p>
                    <p>This project contained many firsts for me, including implementation of a CI/CD pipeline, use of the
                        Serverless Application Model CLI tool, and creation of an AWS Lambda function. I spent numerous
                        research hours online as I worked towards completion of the website and its backend counter. I
                        attempted to write the Lambda code myself, but ended up referencing several other similar functions
                        to piece together a working solution.</p>
                    <p>Since the completion of this project, I have learned quite a bit more about coding and about the way
                        these services function and work together. It would be an interesting exercise to see if I could
                        author the Lambda function on my own at this point.</p>

                    <h5>An API-based Python GUI app</h5>
                    <p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Python</li>
                            <li>guizero, tkinter, requests</li>
                        </ul>
                    </p>
                    <p>After working with the <a href="https://pixe.la/" target="_blank">Pixe.la</a> APIs through the
                        console during a bootcamp project, I decided to create a graphical user interface application that
                        would allow me to track my time spent coding and learning on a pixel graph. I reused the
                        API-related code that I had authored during the bootcamp project and built the GUI from scratch.</p>
                    <p>This was my first coding side project, written over the course of a week as I moved on to other
                        Python lessons. I am particularly pleased with my implementation of guizero, a wrapper for tkinter
                        that I had not used before. I relied heavily on the guizero documentation for reference.</p>
                    <p>Some notable challenges:</p>
                    <p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Image resizing: I wanted to include the Pixe.la logo as part of the app's header, but when
                                I defined the desired width and height of the image, only a small corner of the full image
                                was shown in the app window. Some searching led me to discover that guizero required the
                                Pillow library to scale images. Installing the Pillow package created the desired
                                outcome.</li>
                            <li>Error handling: the Pixe.la API requires the 'date' header to follow a specific format, so
                                I needed to both convert the date string entered into the app, and catch other errors
                                before data was passed to the API. I learned how to use a try/except block to catch invalid
                                entries, and used the datetime module and strftime to convert the date entry into an
                                appropriate date object.</li>
                            <li>GUI operation: I wanted the app to have a reset button to clear text boxes and reset radio
                                button selections. Research revealed that guizero did not include wrappers for this type of
                                functionality, but that I could use tkinter methods with guizero to solve this challenge.
                                In the case of resetting radio buttons, this involved creating a list of the options and
                                calling tk.select() on the desired list index.</li>
                            <li>Including the graph: Pixe.la graphs are rendered in SVG format in a browser window. I
                                attempted to figure out how to display a graph in the GUI window, only to discover that
                                there doesn't seem to be a Python library that can handle SVG code effectively without
                                relying upon a separate image processing application. I did not like the idea of having to
                                include a separate program with this app, so I settled for a button that opens a link to
                                the selected graph in a new browser tab.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </p>
                    <p>For the time being, this application is complete. Future improvements may include: creating an
                        executable using PyInstaller; adding the ability to register new users and create new graphs;
                        displaying a graph in the app window if a library for doing so becomes available.</p>
